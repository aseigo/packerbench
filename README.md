# Packerbench

A suite of benchmarks for [Packer](https://hex.pm/packages/packer). It expects
Packer to be checked out next to it in the filesystem, rather than grabbing a
specific release or even from git. This is to enable testing the impact
of changes locally as well as comparison between different versions.
